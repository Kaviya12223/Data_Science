**🚀 Breast Cancer Prediction Using R: A Comprehensive Analysis 🌟**

**🛠️ Project Overview**
In this project, I implemented various techniques to analyze and predict breast cancer outcomes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.


**🔍 Data Analysis and Visualization**
Data Preparation:

Loaded and processed the dataset, transforming categorical diagnosis labels into factors for analysis.
Visualization:

Pie Chart: Illustrated the distribution of benign and malignant diagnoses.
Histogram: Showed the distribution of the normalized area_mean feature.
Pair Plot: Visualized relationships between selected features and diagnosis categories.
Data Normalization:

Normalized the dataset features to prepare for model training.


**🔬 Model Training and Evaluation**
Train-Test Split:

Divided the data into training and testing sets.
KNN Algorithm:

Applied the KNN algorithm to predict diagnoses.
Performance Evaluation:

Cross Table: Assessed the model's performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
Confusion Matrix: Provided insights into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Accuracy: 98%
Sensitivity: 100%
Specificity: 91.3%
Kappa: 0.9418


**📊 Tools and Libraries**
Utilized libraries including ggplot2, caret, class, gmodels, lattice, and GGally for visualization and analysis.
